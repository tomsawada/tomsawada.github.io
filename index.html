				<p>The basis of the idea came from this book excerpt:</p> 
<q>I actually have a countdown clock that Matt Groening at Futurama was inspired by, and they did a little episode of Futurama about it. I took the actuarial tables for the estimated age of my death, for someone born when I was born, and I worked back the number of days. I have that showing on my computer, how many days. I tell you, nothing concentrates your time like knowing how many days you have left. Now, of course, I’m likely to live longer than that. I’m in good health, etc. But nonetheless, I have 6,000-something days. It’s not very many days to do all the things I want to do.</q>

<h4>About this app</h4>
<p>Based on the work by <a href="https://statistics.wharton.upenn.edu/profile/foster/" target="_Blank">Professor Dean Foster</a> and using CDC’s life tables, as well as statistics by the WHO, we’ve created this estimator for how many days you have to live. 
It works like a clock, every day one day goes by. You get to fully experience how time goes by. It helps you focus, seize each day, question your habits and make the best out of your life. </p>
<h4>Changes in your life</h4>
<p>If something changes in your life - you quit smoking, exercise more, drink less alcohol -, you can easily recalculate and see how your habits impact your life expectancy. 
Of course, this app is based on statistical information and calculations. Nobody knows exactly when your time is up, but it works as a fantastic reminder of the time you have and how you are affecting it by your health and habits. 
</p>
<h4>Data use</h4>
<p>This app does not require you to log in, nor it will ask you any personally identifiable information. We do not store, see, nor use your information in any way. All calculations are done locally in your device, so your data never leaves your phone or tablet. </p>
